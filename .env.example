# regardless of time (useful for testing)
# Default: false
# Important: Set to false for production use!

# Time Simulation (for local testing)
# If set, uses this time instead of the current system time
# Format: ISO-8601 (e.g., "2025-12-27T10:15:00+01:00")
# Useful for testing time-based notification logic locally
# Example: Set to 15 minutes before a talk start time to test notification sending
# Leave empty or unset to use real system time
# SIMULATE_CURRENT_TIME=2025-12-27T10:15:00+01:00
